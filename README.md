# Scala Practice Problems

This repository contains my solutions to the [Ninety-Nine Scala Problems](http://aperiodic.net/phil/scala/s-99/). For
these problems I try to use a variety of styles that are available in Scala including simple recursion, tail-recursion (
which is the same as recursion but it ends in the recursive call, allowing the Scala compiler to rewrite it as a branch
to reduce memory usage), and function programming. To run these solutions I use Scala Worksheets, which is an IntelliJ
feature that's basically a REPL but compiles and runs on save. It makes it quicker for me to put down my ideas. If you
want to run these solutions, you can clone this project onto your machine and import it into IntelliJ as a Gradle
project. Then, use IntelliJ's Gradle plugin to build and compile the code. If you have the Scala plugin installed, then
you can open each of the worksheets and see the output beside each line of code.
